# ML Algorithm Selection

For this exercise, we will have a look at the simplest version of Automated
Machine Learning and choose the best type of machine learning model for a given
task. The end result (i.e. the predictive performance) is not important; how
you get there is.

Your deliverable will be a report, written in a style that it
would be suitable for inclusion in an academic paper as the "Experimental
Setup" section or similar. If unsure, check an academic paper of your choice,
for example [this one](https://www.eecs.uwyo.edu/~larsko/papers/pulatov_opening_2022-1.pdf). The
level of detail should be higher than in a typical academic paper though. Your
report should be at most five pages, including references and figures but
excluding appendices. It should have the following structure:
- Introduction: What problem are you solving, how are you going to solve it.
- Dataset Description: Describe the data you're using, e.g. how many features and observations, what are you predicting, any missing values, etc.
- Experimental Setup: What specifically are you doing to solve the problem, i.e. what programming languages and libraries, how are you processing the data, what machine learning algorithms are you considering, how are you evaluating them, etc.
- Results: Description of what you observed, including plots.
- Code: Add the code you've used as a separate file.

Your report must contain enough detail to reproduce what you did without the
code. If in doubt, include more detail.

There is no required format for the report. You could, for example, use an
iPython notebook.

## Data

We will have a look at the [Wine Quality
dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). Choose the
one that corresponds to your preference in wine. You may also use a dataset of
your choice, for example one that's relevant to your research.

Choose a small number of different machine learning algorithms. For example, you
could use a random forest, support vector machine, linear/logistic regression, a
decision/regression tree learner, and gradient boosting. You will also have to
choose their hyperparameters, e.g. the default values. Determine the best
machine learning algorithm for your dataset, where the "best" algorithm could be
a set of algorithms. Make sure that the way you evaluate this avoids bias and
overfitting. You could use statistical tests to make this determination.

## Submission

Add your report and code to this repository. Bonus points if you can set up a
Github action to automatically run the code and generate the report!
